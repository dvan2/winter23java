This is Project 6 for Advance Programming in Java.  This project introduces us to the Android Studio environment and how it is similar to Intelli J IDE.

There are 2 main feature of this program: Adding flights and airlines to the program and searching for existing flights.
When the program is launched, the homepage starts out empty.  If an airline is added to the program during the current session, the homepage will be filled with airlines that was just created.
Each newly added flights is added to a file when the Submit button is pressed.  Each airline is stored in its own file.

The search feature prompts for an airline name, a source and a destination.  This feature searches based on the airline name to see if the file exists.
This means it is capable of getting flights from previous sessions.  If the source and destination is ommited, it will find all matched airlines.

The options should come before the arguments.  Available options are -README, -print, -textFile <filename>, -pretty - or -pretty <filename>.  These commands must come before the information about the airlines.
To use this program properly, ensure that the options are spelled correctly and the arguments comes in the order that is specified.

The 6 arguments and their orders are:
1. Airline name
2. The flight number
3. The source departure airport (3 letter code)
4. The departure date in the format mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm AM/PM(AM or PM)
5. The destination airport (3 letter code)
7. The arrival date in the format mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm AM/PM(AM or PM)
