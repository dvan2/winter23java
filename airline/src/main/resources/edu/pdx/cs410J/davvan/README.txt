Project 1 is a simple program where the user is able to use the command line arguments to create a flight.
2 options are available along with 6 arguments for information about airline and flight.

The options should come before the arguments.  Available options are -README and -print.  These commands must come before the information about the airlines.
To use this program properly, ensure that the options are spelled correctly and the arguments comes in the order that is specified.

The 6 arguments and their orders are:
1. Airline name
2. The flight number
3. The source departure airport (3 letter code)
4. The departure date in the format mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm
5. The destination airport (3 letter code)
6. The arrival date in the format mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm

Separate these arguments with a space.
